							In the proposed approach, latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and parts of speech (POS) tags are used
							together to detect plagiarism between the sample and a number of source documents. The basic
							hypothesis is that considering semantic and syntactic information between two text documents may
							improve the performance of the plagiarism detection task. Our method is based on two steps, naming,
							which is a pre-processing where we detect the topics from the sentences in documents using the LDA
							and convert each sentence in POS tags array; then a post processing step where the suspicious cases
							are verified purely on the basis of semantic rules. For two types of external plagiarism (copy and
							random obfuscation), we empirically compare our approach to the state-of-the-art N-gram based and

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Social media has an impact on many aspects of human life ranging from sharing personal information to revolutionizing political systems of entire countries. One not so well studied aspect of social media is analyzing its usage and efficacy in healthcare, particularly in developing countries which lack state-of-the-art healthcare systems and processes. In such countries, social media may be used to facilitate patient-centric healthcare by involving the patient for fulfilling personal healthcare needs. This article provides an in-depth analysis of one such need, that is, how people use social media to request for blood donations. We study the request and dissemination behavior of people using social media to fulfill blood donation requests. We focus on twitter, and blood donation accounts in India. Our study reveals that each of the seven twitter accounts we studied have a large followership of more than 35,000 users on an average and receive a substantial number (more than 900) of donation requests in a day on an average. We analyze the requests in various ways to present an outlook for healthcare providers to make their systems more patient-centric through a better understanding of the needs of people requesting for blood donations. Our study also identifies areas where future social media enabled automated healthcare systems can focus on the needs of individual patients. These systems can provide support for saving more lives by reducing the gap between blood donors and the people in need. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Considerable interest has been devoted for developing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of healthy biological systems and how these dynamics are affected due to aging and disease. Entropy based complexity measures have widely been used for quantifying the dynamics of physical and biological systems. These techniques have provided valuable information leading to a fuller understanding of the dynamics of these systems and underlying stimuli that are responsible for anomalous behavior. The single scale based traditional entropy measures yielded contradictory results about the dynamics of real world time series data of healthy and pathological subjects. Recently the multiscale entropy (MSE) algorithm was introduced for precise description of the complexity of biological signals, which was used in numerous fields since its inception. The original MSE quantified the complexity of coarse-grained time series using sample entropy. The original MSE may be unreliable for short signals because the length of the coarse-grained time series decreases with increasing scaling factor τ, however, MSE works well for long signals. To overcome the drawback of original MSE, various variants of this method have been proposed for evaluating complexity efficiently. In this study, we have proposed multiscale normalized corrected Shannon entropy (MNCSE), in which instead of using sample entropy, symbolic entropy measure NCSE has been used as an entropy estimate. The results of the study are compared with traditional MSE. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using noise signals as well as interbeat interval signals from healthy and pathological subjects. The preliminary results of the study indicate that MNCSE values are more stable and reliable than original MSE values. The results show that MNCSE based features lead to higher classification accuracies in comparison with the MSE based features. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Several prior studies have demonstrated the possibility of tracking the outbreak and spread of diseases using public tweets and other social media platforms. However, almost all such prior studies were restricted to geographically filtered English language tweets only. This study is the first to attempt a similar approach for Arabic language tweets originating from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. We obtained a list of commonly occurring diseases in the region from the Saudi Ministry of Health. We used both the English disease names as well as their Arabic translations to filter the stream of tweets. We acquired old tweets for a period spanning 29 months. All tweets were geographically filtered for the Middle East and the list of disease names in both English and Arabic languages. We observed that only a small fraction of tweets were in English, demonstrating that prior approaches to disease tracking relying on English language features are less effective for this region. We also demonstrate how Arabic language tweets can be used rather effectively to track the spread of some infectious diseases in the region. We verified our approach by demonstrating that a high degree of correlation between the occurrence of MERS-Coronavirus cases and Arabic language tweets on the disease. We also show that infectious diseases generating fewer tweets and non-infectious diseases do not exhibit the same high correlation. We also verify the usefulness of tracking cases using Twitter mentions by comparing against a ground truth data set of MERS-CoV cases obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

It focuses on Web-scale services and systems facilitating location-aware information access as well as on Spatial Social Behavior Analytics on the Web as part of social computing. The location topic is seen as a cross-cutting issue equally concerning information access, semantics and standards, social analysis and mining, and Web-scale systems and services. The workshop is an integrated venue where location and spatio-social aspects can be discussed in depth with an interested community. New application areas for Web architecture, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web of Things (WoT), will lead to increasingly rich and large sets of applications for which location is highly relevant as the connection to the physical world.

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Online Social Networks (OSNs) allow users to share knowledge, opinions, interests, activities, relationships and friendships with each other. Gender classification of users of an OSN such as Twitter may be difficult to ascertain because gender is not necessarily provided. The present invention relates to a computer-implemented method for predicting gender classification of users of an OSN such as Twitter. The computer-implemented method may predict gender using five color-based features extracted from Twitter profiles such as the background color in a user's profile page. This is in contrast with most existing methods for gender prediction that are language dependent. Those methods use high-dimensional spaces consisting of unique words extracted from such text fields as postings, user names, and profile descriptions. The present method is independent of the user's language, efficient, scalable, and computationally tractable, while attaining a good level of accuracy. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

Kernel Mapping Recommender (KMR) systems have been proposed, which give state-of-the-art performance. However, the performance of the KMR algorithm suffers under cold-start and sparse problems. From this line of research, this paper proposes a hybrid framework that can efficiently integrate different versions, namely, item-based and user-based KMR — of KMR algorithm. We have proposed various heuristic algorithms that integrate different versions of KMR (into a unified framework) resulting in improved accuracy and elimination of problems associated with conventional recommender system. We have tested our system on publically available movies dataset and benchmark with KMR. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm yields robust results under cold-start and sparse scenarios. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

Intruder groups are using handful tactics and radicalism has disparaging effects, particularly in Gulf and Pakistan region. Forecasting the pattern of attacks is a complex task. This research paper presents new insights on intruder groups and targets using data mining algorithms. We propose a framework, which uses historical data to train machine-learning classifiers and can predict intruder groups and attack types based on selected features. We analyzed that the major victims of intruder groups would be citizen and property, government, police, and military sectors. We figured out that J48 and IBK learning algorithms perform consistently well under various experimental settings. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Twitter is a popular microblogging platform, with 310 million monthly active users as of the first quarter of 2016. It is a rapidly growing microblogging platform where people share opinions, news on any topic of their interest. More than 7000 tweets are posted every second. Due to the enormous volume of data being generated, it becomes difficult to extract useful/meaningful information. Tweets collected from Twitter on a certain topic may consist of numerous conversation threads about relevant sub-topics. However, it is difficult to discern these sub-topics if the data is visualised as a single word cloud. The authors transform a corpus of tweets to a spectral domain and evaluate the results from a number of clustering algorithms, including K-means, latent semantic indexing and non-negative matrix factorisation to construct clustered word clouds that helps identify sub-topics under a broader topic. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">OpenFlow enabled networks split and separate the data and control planes of traditional networks. This design commodifies network switches and enables centralized control of the network. Control decisions are made by an OpenFlow controller, and locally cached by switches, as directed by controllers. This can significantly impact the forwarding delay incurred by packets in switches, because controllers are not necessarily co-located with switches. Only very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of OpenFlow in terms of end-to-end delay. In this paper, we develop a stochastic model for the end to end delay in OpenFlow switches based on measurements made in Internet-scale experiments performed on three different platforms, i.e., Mininet, the GENI testbed, and the OF@TEIN testbed. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

								<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Student surveys occupy a central place in the evaluation of courses at teaching institutions. At the end of each course, students are requested to evaluate various aspects such as activities, methodology, coordination or resources used. In addition, a final qualification is given to summarize the quality of the course. The prediction of this final qualification can be accomplished by using monotonic classification techniques. The outcome offered by these surveys is particularly significant for faculty and teaching staff associated with the course.
									<br>The monotonic nearest neighbor classifier is one of the most relevant algorithms in monotonic classification. However, it does suffer from two drawbacks, (a) inefficient execution time in classification and (b) sensitivity to no monotonic examples. Prototype selection is a data reduction process for classification based on nearest neighbor that can be used to alleviate these problems. This paper proposes a prototype selection algorithm called Monotonic Iterative Prototype Selection (MONIPS) algorithm. Our objective is two-fold. The first one is to introduce MONIPS as a method for obtaining monotonic solutions. MONIPS has proved to be competitive with classical prototype selection solutions adapted to monotonic domain. Besides, to further demonstrate the good performance of MONIPS in the context of a student survey about taught courses.

								<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">The user participatory nature of the social web has revolutionized the use of the conventional web. The social web is an integral part of our daily life. Due to the resulting exponential growth of the social web, a number of research domains have emerged, involving research activities that aim to study human nature, to analyse human sentiments and emotions, and to find the impact of various users in the social networks. Recently, the research focus has shifted to identifying a user's influence on other users in a social network. In the recent literature, we find a number of models proposed to find the most influential users in the blogging community. In this paper, we review the models to find these influential bloggers. The existing models are classified into feature-based and network-based categories. The feature-based models consider the salient factors to measure bloggers' influence. The network models, on the other hand, consider the graph-based social network structure of the bloggers to identify those who have the most impact on fellow members. This survey introduces each model with its features, novel aspects, and the datasets used. In addition to the discussion about the model, a comparative analysis of the datasets is presented. We conclude by discussing applications of the relevant literature, exploring open research issues and challenges, and sharing possible future directions in this active area of research.

								<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Social media has an impact on many aspects of human life ranging from sharing personal information to revolutionizing political systems of entire countries. One not so well studied aspect of social media is analyzing its usage and efficacy in healthcare, particularly in developing countries which lack state-of-the-art healthcare systems and processes. In such countries, social media may be used to facilitate patient-centric healthcare by involving the patient for fulfilling personal healthcare needs. This article provides an in-depth analysis of one such need, that is, how people use social media to request for blood donations. We study the request and dissemination behavior of people using social media to fulfill blood donation requests. We focus on twitter, and blood donation accounts in India. Our study reveals that each of the seven twitter accounts we studied have a large followership of more than 35,000 users on an average and receive a substantial number (more than 900) of donation requests in a day on an average. We analyze the requests in various ways to present an outlook for healthcare providers to make their systems more patient-centric through a better understanding of the needs of people requesting for blood donations. Our study also identifies areas where future social media enabled automated healthcare systems can focus on the needs of individual patients. These systems can provide support for saving more lives by reducing the gap between blood donors and the people in need. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting deceptive profiles in OSNs. We specifically define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders and locations in Twitter. First, we collected a large dataset of Twitter profiles and tweets. Next, we defined methods for gender guessing from Twitter profile colors and names. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian classification and K-means clustering algorithms to Twitter profile characteristics (e.g., profile layout colors, first names, user names, and spatiotemporal information) and geolocations to analyze the user behavior. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator through extensive experimentation with our crawled dataset. Based on the outcomes of our approach, we are able to detect deceptive profiles about gender and location with a reasonable accuracy. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Over the past decade Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been helping hundreds of millions of people develop reliable computer-mediated relations. However, many user profiles in OSNs contain misleading, inconsistent or false information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user's privacy. In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for information posted on OSNs to be trusted. Here we define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders in Twitter. In addition, we report empirical results with our stratified data set consisting of 174,600 Twitter profiles with a 50-50 breakdown between male and female users. Our automated approach compares gender indicators obtained from different profile characteristics including first name, user name, and layout colors. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator and the strength of all possible values for each indicator through extensive experimentations with our data set. We define male trending users and female trending users based on two factors, namely the overall accuracy of each characteristic and the relative strength of the value of each characteristic for a given user. We apply a Bayesian classifier to the weighted average of characteristics for each user. We flag for possible deception profiles that we classify as male or female in contrast with a self-declared gender that we obtain independently of Twitter profiles. Finally, we use manual inspections on a subset of profiles that we identify as potentially deceptive in order to verify the correctness of our predictions. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

They are now a part of the lives of dozens of millions of people. The onset of OSNs has stretched the traditional notion of community to include groups of people who have never met in person but communicate with each other through OSNs to share knowledge, opinions, interests and activities. Here we explore in depth language independent gender classification. Our approach predicts gender using five color-based features extracted from Twitter profiles such as the background color in a user’s profile page. This is in contrast with most existing methods for gender prediction that are language dependent. Those methods use high-dimensional spaces consisting of unique words extracted from such text fields as postings, user names, and profile descriptions. Our approach is independent of the user’s language, efficient, scalable, and computationally tractable, while attaining a good level of accuracy. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

The volume of texts generated by OSNs is huge and highly informative. Gender classification can serve commercial organizations for advertising, law enforcement for legal investigation, and others for social reasons. Here we explore profile characteristics for gender classification on Twitter. Unlike existing approaches to gender classification that depend heavily on posted text such as tweets, here we study the relative strengths of different characteristics extracted from Twitter profiles (eg, first name and background color in a user’s profile page). Our goal is to evaluate profile characteristics with respect to their predictive accuracy and computational complexity. In addition, we provide a novel technique to reduce the number of features of text-based profile characteristics from the order of millions to a few thousands and, in some cases, to only 40 features. We prove the validity of our approach by examining different classifiers over a large dataset of Twitter profiles. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">The industry of software applications has been increased significantly because of the high demand of using the software applications. This revolution leads on developing many concurrent software systems. Noticeably, some of these concurrent software systems have falsely report data race condition to one or more of their shared variables. Debugging such concurrent software systems to find the race condition is a challenge, especially for large and complex software systems. Since the race condition concerned mostly ignored in the concurrent software systems, adopting it could help to ensure the efficiency of these software systems. There are few detector tools that have been known in the industry focusing on data race detectors. This paper aims to study those tools. We are going to conduct empirical study of data race using well known tools in order to measure the correctness, performances and effectiveness of those tools in practical by using some benchmarks. Those benchmarks will be tested on each tool and compare it with others to see the similarity and differentiate. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Online Social Networks (OSNs) generate a huge volume of user-originated texts. Gender classification can serve multiple purposes. For example, commercial organizations can use gender classification for advertising. Law enforcement may use gender classification as part of legal investigations. Others may use gender information for social reasons. Here we explore language independent gender classification. Our approach predicts gender using five color-based features extracted from Twitter profiles (e.g., the background color in a user's profile page). Most other methods for gender prediction are typically language dependent. Those methods use high-dimensional spaces consisting of unique words extracted from such text fields as postings, user names, and profile descriptions. Our approach is independent of the user's language, efficient, and scalable, while attaining a good level of accuracy. We prove the validity of our approach by examining different classifiers over a large dataset of Twitter profiles. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">Understanding the mobility of a traveller from mobile sensor data is an important area of work in context aware and ubiquitous computing. Given a multimodal GPS trace, we will identify where in the GPS trace the traveller changed transportation modes. For example, where in the GPS trace the traveller alight a bus and boards a train, or where did the client stop running and start walking. Using data mining schemes to understand mobility data, in conjunction with real world observations, we propose an algorithm to identify mobility transfer points automatically. We compared the proposed algorithm against the state of the art that is used in the previously proposed work. Evaluation on real world data collected from GPS enabled mobile phones indicate that the proposed algorithm is accurate, has a good coverage, and a good asymptotic run time complexity. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">The high-demand from the software industry led to the development of many Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models that help produce high quality software within budget and time constraints. Most of these SDLC models do not completely cover security as early as possible in the development cycle. Since security is a major concern to the users and the developers, adopting it at the early stages of the SDLC could help to ensure integrity, accessibility and confidentiality in future systems. It is still unclear how to achieve a perfectly secured software system by modifying the SDLC models. In this paper, the Knowledge Based Security System (KBSS) model is proposed to help in modeling and specifying security at all stages of SDLC in an effort to achieve a maximally secured software system. KBSS is a system that categorizes, clusters, monitors, alerts, and controls the Security Knowledge Management by the knowledge of the Security Expert Team, who are able to identify, collect, organize, manage, retrieve, provide and store all aspects of security functions and issues. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">The contribution of this work is the creation of a novel system that enables motorists who witness incidents to submit reports to our system via the web. These reports are aggregated, validated and verified automatically. Then, they are used to update the road network graph. In this work, we designed and implemented an incident reporting system whereby users can report an incident such as an accident or construction on a road network. We extended the FreeSim simulator to accommodate our incident reporting system. Experimental results showed that our system is capable of reducing the travel time of users. We also presented our verification algorithms that are used to verify that reports are fact. Current approaches to congestion detection such as loop detectors probe vehicles, and video image detection may not be available on arterial streets. These technologies may not be available in countries whose transportation budget is low. Our model is less expensive, easy to implement and can work in any environment (eg extreme weather). This work is dependent on people’s incident response input and not from sensor signals converted to traffic measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to consider web-based incident Crowd Sourcing with automatic incident verification. Other driver based models are telephoned based. <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>

						<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#">Read More</a><p class="read-more-content">A recent report issued by the Software Engineering Institute entitled “Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Future Challenge of Software Engineering,” outlines the concept of Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems for which size and complexity is expected to increase exponentially from most of the systems we build today [1]. Traditional requirements elicitation techniques are unlikely to scale well to handle the thousands of stakeholders in involved in ULS systems. A new framework has therefore been proposed for managing large-scaled and distributed requirements elicitation processes [2]. The framework involves a requirements gathering phase in which stakeholders describe their needs for the project. Unsupervised clustering techniques are then used to identify dominant topics and then to generate corresponding discussion forums at which project stakeholders work collaboratively to gather information, generate ideas … <a class="read-more-hide hide" href="#">Read Less</a></p>
